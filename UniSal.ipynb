    "Although data about faculty salaries at private universities can be difficult to find, getting data regarding faculty salaries at public universities is much easier. I've always been curious (even though I don't want to go into academia myself!) which fields pay the best and why and if there is a way to predict your salary if you are going to be a professor at a certain university. \n",

    "So, I decided to make this a project I would explore and use two of the very best data science tools to do it: Python and R! Thanks to the rpy2 library and IPython's R magic, I can now include R code inside the notebook instead of having to switch between knitr and here. The first half will be about cleaning and EDA (exploratory data analysis): a key first step of any data science project dealing with structured data especially. The second half will be about machine learning and applying a model for regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Python is making improvements in [visualization](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/), I still prefer R for this part. Combining the great tools of the [plyr library](http://plyr.had.co.nz/) for splitting the data into pieces with the beautiful visualization of the [ggplot2 library](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) makes this look much better than Python's current offerings.
