    "[Recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) have become a very important part of the retail, social networking, and entertainment industries. From providing advice on songs for you to try, suggesting books for you to read, or finding clothes to buy, recommender systems have greatly improved the ability of customers to make choices more easily. \n",

    "Why is it so important for customers to have support in decision making? A well-cited study (over 2000 citations so far!) by [Iyengar and Lepper](https://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Iyengar%20%26%20Lepper%20%282000%29.pdf) ran an experiment where they had two stands of jam on two different days. One stand had 24 varieties of jam while the second had only six. The stand with 24 varieties of jam only converted 3% of the customers to a sale, while the stand with only six varieties converted 30% of the customers. This was an increase in sales of nearly ten-fold!"

Most songs are based on a feature vector of approximately 450 features, which were derived in a very long and arduous process. Once you have this feature set, one technique that works well enough is to treat the recommendation problem as a binary classification problem. This allows one to use more traditional machine learning techniques that output a probability for a certain user to like a specific song based on a training set of their song listening history. Then, simply recommend the songs with the greatest probability of being liked. \n",

We discussed before how collaborative filtering doesn't require any information about the users or items. Well, is there another way we can figure out how the users and the items are related to each other? \n",

Often, matrix factorization is applied in the realm of dimensionality reduction, where we are trying to reduce the number of features while still keeping the relevant information. This is the case with [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (PCA) and the very similar [singular value decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) (SVD). \n",

    "As the image below demonstrates, let's assume we have an original ratings matrix $R$ of size $MxN$, where $M$ is the number of users and $N$ is the number of items. This matrix is quite sparse, since most users only interact with a few items each. We can factorize this matrix into two separate smaller matrices: one with dimensions $MxK$ which will be our latent user feature vectors for each user $(U)$ and a second with dimensions $KxN$, which will have our latent item feature vectors for each item $(V)$. Multiplying these two feature matrices together approximates the original matrix, but now we have two matrices that are dense including a number of latent features $K$ for each of our items and users.

In the case of ALS, we only need to solve one feature vector at a time, which means it can be run in parallel! (This large advantage is probably why it is the method of choice for Spark). To do this, we can randomly initialize $U$ and solve for $V$. Then we can go back and solve for $U$ using our solution for $V$. Keep iterating back and forth like this until we get a convergence that approximates $R$ as best as we can. \n",

    "After this has been finished, we can simply take the dot product of $U$ and $V$ to see what the predicted rating would be for a specific user/item interaction, even if there was no prior interaction.

Fortunately, as I was still finishing this up, Ben Frederickson at Flipboard had perfect timing and came out with a version of ALS for Python utilizing Cython and parallelizing the code among threads. You can read his blog post about using it for finding similar music artists using matrix factorization [here](http://www.benfrederickson.com/matrix-factorization/) and his implicit library [here](https://github.com/benfred/implicit). He claims it is even faster than Quora's C++ [QMF](https://github.com/quora/qmf), but I haven't tried theirs. All I can tell you is that it is over 1000 times faster than this bare bones pure Python version when I tested it. Install this library before you continue and follow the instructions. If you have conda installed, just do pip install implicit and you should be good to go. "

A commonly used metric for this kind of problem is the area under the [Receiver Operating Characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) (or ROC) curve. A greater area under the curve means we are recommending items that end up being purchased near the top of the list of recommended items.

It will also work well for our purposes of ranking recommendations.\n",

If you are interested in taking recommender systems to the next level, a hybrid system would be best that incorporates information about your users/items along with the purchase history. A Python library called LightFM from Maciej Kula at Lyst looks very interesting for this sort of application. You can find it [here](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm). \n",
