    "[XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) has become incredibly popular on [Kaggle in the last year](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/tree/master/demo#machine-learning-challenge-winning-solutions) for any problems dealing with structured data. I was already familiar with [sklearn's version](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-boosting) of gradient boosting and have used it before, but I hadn't really considered trying XGBoost instead until I became more familiar with it. I was perfectly happy with sklearn's version and didn't think much of switching. So why have so many started using it? There are a variety of answers I am sure others have come up with, but the main reason for me can be summarized in one word:\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see from [this paper](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v42/chen14.pdf) on XGBoost's first major debut in the [Higgs-Boson Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson) that XGBoost has a nice speed advantage over sklearn. Here is Figure 3 from the paper:\n",

    "In addition, Szilard Pafka has done an [excellent benchmark](https://github.com/szilard/benchm-ml) of a variety of machine learning libraries and he also found XGBoost to be much faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about XGBoost makes it faster? Gradient boosted trees, as you may be aware, have to be built in series so that a step of gradient descent can be taken in order to minimize a loss function. Unlike Random Forests, you can't simply build the trees in parallel. XGBoost, however, builds the tree **itself** in a parallel fashion. You can see more details about this in section 4.1 of the XGBoost paper by Chen and Guestrin [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754v1.pdf), but essentially the information contained in each feature column can have statistics calculated on it in parallel (along with an initial sort of the columns). \n",
    "\n",
    "What you get in return for this speed is a much faster grid search for optimizing hyperparameters in model tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "To show you what the library can do in addition to some of its more advanced features, I am going to walk us through an example classification problem with the library. "

    "I decided a nice dataset to use for this example comes yet again from the UC-Irvine Machine Learning repository. This dataset is the classic [\"Adult Data Set\"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). An older set from 1996, this dataset contains census data on income. Our job is to predict whether a certain individual had an income of greater than 50,000 based on their demographic information. In the dataset description found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names), we can see that the best model they came up with at the time had an accuracy of 85.95% (14.05% error on the test set). Let's see if we can beat that, shall we?\n",

    "Our next step is to use ordinal encoding for the features with a string category since XGBoost (like all of the other machine learning algorithms in Python) requires every feature vector to include only digits. To do this properly, however, we will need to join the two together and apply our encoding so that the same categories exist in both datasets when we do train/test evalulation. There is some debate as to whether you are technically supposed to use one-hot encoding for categorical features (since there isn't supposed to be any inherent ordering) but I found [this discussion](https://github.com/szilard/benchm-ml/issues/1) on the subject interesting. It seems that one-hot encoding isn't necessary for tree-based algorithms, but you may run into a problem using this on linear models. I personally find ordinal encoding is more than sufficient and it significantly reduces your memory footprint if you have quite a few categorical features. \n",

This may be because we are just predicting a specific threshold (below/above 50000 a year) instead of a precise income. \n",

    "In this post, we explored some of the basic functionality involving the XGBoost library. We also learned how it works and why it performs faster than other gradient boosting libraries do. As a test, we used it on an example dataset of US incomes, beating the performance of other documented models for the dataset with very little effort. We were also able to investigate feature importances to see which features were influencing the model most. \n",
    "\n",
    "Possible ideas for using XGBoost in the future:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure to read the [documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) thoroughly if you want to utilize some of its more advanced features\n",
    "- This is a rapidly evolving library, so additional features may be introduced that affect its functionality\n",
    "- XGBoost is available in most of the other common languages for data science as well such as Julia and R if those are preferable\n",
    "- XGBoost can also now be utilized at scale, running on Spark and Flink with the recently released [XGBoost4J](http://dmlc.ml/2016/03/14/xgboost4j-portable-distributed-xgboost-in-spark-flink-and-dataflow.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other helpful information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufHo8vbk6g4) given by Tong He on XGBoost in detail. This describes the R version, but the API is very similar and there is a lot of great information in here on how XGBoost actually works.\n",
    "- Here is his [slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/ShangxuanZhang/xgboost) that covers the same material.\n",
    "- Another tutorial guide on hyperparameter tuning from Aarshay Jain [here](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I wanted to start using XGBoost because of how fast it is and the great success many Kaggle competition entrants have had with the library so far. I've began using it in my own work and have been very pleased with the speed increase. If you have a modeling problem involving structured data, I'd encourage you to give the library a try! Thanks to all of the XGBoost developers and contributors for such a wonderful library."
